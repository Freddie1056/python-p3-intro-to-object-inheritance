# Intro to Object Inheritance

## Learning Goals

- Reduce repeated code and enhance objects using inheritance.
- Accomplish complex programming tasks using knowledge from previous modules.

## Key Vocab

- **Inheritance**: a tool that allows us to recycle code by creating a class
that "inherits" the attributes and methods of a parent class.
- **Composition**: a tool that enables you to recycle code by adding objects to
other objects. Rather than building on a base class as in inheritance,
composition leverages the attributes and methods of an instance of another class.
- **Subclass**: a class that inherits from another class. Colloquially called
a "child" class.
- **Superclass**: a class that is inherited by another class. Colloquially
called a "parent" class.
- **Child**: another name for a subclass.
- **Parent**: another name for a superclass.
- **`super()`**: a built-in Python function that allows us to manipulate the
attributes and methods of a superclass from the body of its subclass.
- **Decorator**: syntax that allows us to add functionality to an object
without modifying its structure.

## Introduction

The concept of inheritance in Python works similarly to the real world â€” A
prince can inherit a kingdom and everything within it; a baby can inherit
genetic traits from a parent. In Python, a class can inherit the behaviors of
another class, referred to as the **_superclass_**.

In these lessons, we'll cover:

- What **inheritance** is in object-oriented Python.
- Implementing classes with inherited methods from another class that also has
its own unique methods.
- Refactoring "code smells" into multiple, non-repetitive methods.
- Wrap functions and modify their behavior with **decorators**.
- Using the `super` keyword to inherit from and augment methods in the parent
class.

In this section, we'll explain how we can leverage the power of Python to
define basic classes with large reusability and smaller **subclasses** for more
fine-grained, detailed behaviors.
